        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p class="page-main__about--title">Safety is our topmost Priority</p>
        <p>The safety and security of  our client's funds and information is something we take really seriously. Our strong security protocols give our clients the opportunity to secure their accounts.</p>
        <p class="page-main__about--title">What is importance of securing your account</p>
        <p>As a result of the various transactions made with real money, when you make a deposit you place your money in a Cryptologi account. This is very important that you can control them. If you don't turn on protection features in your account, someone can easily get access to the account and make away with your money.</p>
        <p class="page-main__about--title">Strong password</p>
        <p>It is very important to use a password unique to you alone. This makes it impossible for anyone to steal your money. The password should contain at least a minimum of 8 characters and it should be comprised of small letters, big letters, digits and sometimes even special characters (! # &) as the case may be.</p>
        <p class="page-main__about--title">Two factor authentication(2FA)</p>
        <p>This special feature is available to provide another level of authentication and verification of the right and legal user of an account. With 2FA enabled, you give your account another layer of protection: usually, a one-time code that can only be sent to your mobile devices.</p>
        <p class="page-main__about--title">Our site, services, and personel</p>
        <p>Every online service and communication occur over secured and trusted channels. The various wallets are stored and kept making us of a PGP encryption. No personal of Cryptologi has direct access to any customer's Bitcoin funds. Likewise, no one will ask you for the password to your personal account. We run an impressive but yet simple financial and security  auditing. This gives our customer a guarantee that their funds well safe and accounted for.

        <ul>
          <li>Verification of your account: before a payment is carried out, any user or customer that wants to pay in fiat currencies has to verify their account</li>
          <li>Safety PIN code: a 4 digit code is expected to be set up during account registration. If our customer service is contacted for  anything, no information would be released without the PIN code</li>
          <li>Transfer delay or account blocking: we can block, suspend or deactivate an account in the case when a crime is suspected</li>
          <li>Singular user, one account: one person is allowed to own only one account on Cryptologi</li>
        </ul>
