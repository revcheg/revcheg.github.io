In the case of a cash dividend, a certain amount of money is distributed to each shareholder (e.g., in the case of cash dividend of $0.25 per share, the owner of 100 shares would receive $25 in total). As cash dividends are normally paid to stockholders out of the corporation’s current earnings or accumulated profits their effect is to reduce the equity of the company once issued.</p>

          <div class="glossary__content">
            <p>Threshold securities are US equity securities where, for 5 consecutive settlement days:</p>
            <p>– Have an aggregate fail to deliver position at a NSCC totaling 10,000 shares or more, and<br>– The level of fails equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding, and<br>– Are included on a list published by a self-regulatory organization (SRO).</p>
            <p>Most Pink Sheets securities are excluded from the definition of threshold securities as they are not registered or required to file reports with the SEC. A list of current threshold securities is made available on the OCC’s website at <a href="https://www.theocc.com/" target="_blank">www.theocc.com</a>.</p>

          <button class="glossary__name">Tick</button>
          <div class="glossary__content">
            <p>Tick is the term used to indicate the minimum price movement in a given security. It is known as the minimum price change. For example, the ES futures contract trades in 0.25 increments. Each 0.25 is one tick.</p>
            <p>The tick value is the cash value of one tick (one minimum price movement). For example, again using the ES futures, each 0.25 is valued at USD 12.50. So the tick value for the ES futures is USD 12.50.</p>
