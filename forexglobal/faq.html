          <summary>Why does my stop loss and take profit sometimes show with different colours?</summary>
          <p>You can see some colour adjustments on your take-profit (TP) and stop-loss (SL) orders from the Terminal window, Trade tab. When your TP turns green, it means the current price is within a 10-pip distance from your TP. When your SL turns red it means the current price is within a 10-pip distance from your SL. If your SL is constantly yellow, it means you have a trailing stop (TS) set and therefore your SL can move as the price moves in your favour beyond the pre-set TS level.</p>
