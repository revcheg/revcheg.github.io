        <b>Which platform should you use?</b>

        <p>A certified, original copy of your passport or ID.</p>

        <p>You will need to clearly indicate the beneficiary name on the Multiply Market Customer Agreement.

In addition, if you wish to withdraw funds, it must be to the same beneficiary.</p>
        <b>How do you manage your risk?</b>
        <p>The stop loss order and the limit order are the most common risk management tools in Forex trading. A limit order stets a restriction on the minimum price to be received or the maximum price to be paid. An automatic liquidation at a predetermined price for a particular position is called a stop loss. This is used to limit potential losses if the market moves against an investor’s position.</p>
