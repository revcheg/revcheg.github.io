        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <b>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</b>
        <p>When you use +500crypto, we collect information sent to us through your computer, mobile phone, or any other access device. This information may include your IP address, device information including, but not limited to, identifier, device name and type, operating system, location, mobile network information, and standard web log information, such as your browser type, traffic to and from our site, and the pages you accessed on our website. +500crypto does not intentionally collect information from or about any individual who is under 13 years old. If you create an account or use +500crypto Services, we or our affiliates vendors acting on our behalf may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Financial information - the full bank account and routing numbers and/or credit card numbers that you link to your Coinbase Account or input when you use paid Coinbase Services. If you do not use the Coinbase Conversion Service, you may opt out of providing this information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you seek permissions to raise Digital Currency to buy and sell limits associated with your +500crypto Account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk. This information may include your date of birth, taxpayer or government identification number, a copy of your government-issued identification, or other personal information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.</p>
        <p>When you use +500crypto Services, we collect information about your transactions and/or your other activities on our website and we may continuously collect information about your computer, mobile device, or any other access device for fraud prevention purposes, to monitor for possible breach of your +500crypto Account, and to identify any malicious software or other activity that may harm +500crypto or its users.</p>
        <p>You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. By associating an account managed by a third party with your +500crypto account and authorizing +500crypto to have access to this information, you agree that +500crypto may collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Finally, we may collect additional information you may disclose to our customer support team.</p>
        <b>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
        <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information that has been anonymized so that it does not and cannot be used to identify a specific user. +500crypto takes reasonable precautions, as described herein, to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
        <p>We store and process your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, where +500crypto facilities or our service providers are located, including in the United States of America, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable laws. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to +500crypto staff.</p>
        <p>We store our customers' personal information securely throughout the life of the customer's +500crypto Account. +500crypto will retain your personal information for a minimum of five years or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or to resolve disputes.</p>
        <b>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
        <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:</p>

          <li>Verify your identity by comparing your personal information against third-party databases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="page-header--pb">We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission. From time to time we may request your permission to allow us to share your personal information with third parties. You may opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties, or from allowing us to use your personal information for any purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected it or subsequently obtained your authorization.
